# OS_Prog1
For my assignment I chose to implement Problem A: The Producer-Consumer Problem and Problem D: The Sleeping Barbers Problem.

# How to run:
## Problem A;
1. Type into the console "make prodcon"
2. This will generate an executable named simulation
3. Type into the console "./simulation" to run the executable

## Problem D:
1. Type into the console "make barber"
2. This will generate an executable named simulation
3. Type into the console "./simulation" to run the executable

# How to clean the executable:
1. Type into the console "make clean"
(The executable gets cleaned before every program compilation)
